    <h2>Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.</h2>

    <h3>
      What are Variables? <br />
      Variables are containers for storing data.

    <h3>
      <p>3 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using var</li>
        <li>Using let</li>
        <li>Using const</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <br />

    <h3>
      Some Facts
      <ul>
        <li>Always declare JavaScript variables with var, let or const.</li>
        <li>
          The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
        </li>
        <li>The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.</li>
        <li>
          If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.
        </li>
        <li>A variable can be declared both globally and locally.</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>

    <h3>
      All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These
      unique names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be short names (like
      x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). The general
      rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
      <ul>
        <li>Name must be meaningful.</li>
        <li>
          Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
        </li>
        <li>Names must begin with a letter.</li>
        <li>Names can also begin with $ and _.</li>
        <li>Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).</li>
        <li>
          Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <script>
      let x=5;
      let y=6;
      let z = x + y;
      console.log(z);

      const firstPrice = 300;
      const secondPrice = 400;
      const total = firstPrice + secondPrice;
      console.log(total);
