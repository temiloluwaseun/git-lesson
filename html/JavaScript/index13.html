    <h3>
      Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a
      condition. Conditions typically return true or false. A loop will continue
      running until the defined condition returns false. <br />
      <br />
      Different types of loops in JavaScript include:-
      <ul>
        <li>for - loops through a block of code a number of times</li>
        <li>for/in - loops through the properties of an object</li>
        <li>for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object</li>
        <li>
          while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is
          true
        </li>
        <li>
          do/while - also loops through a block of code while specified
          condition is true
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />
      The for loop consists of three optional expressions, followed by a code
      block:
      <ul>
        <li>
          initialization - This expression runs before the execution of the
          first loop, and is usually used to create a counter.
        </li>
        <li>
          condition - This expression is checked each time before the loop runs.
          If it evaluates to true, the statement or code in the loop is
          executed. If it evaluates to false, the loop stops. And if this
          expression is omitted, it automatically evaluates to true.
        </li>
        <li>
          finalExpression - This expression is executed after each iteration of
          the loop. This is usually used to increment a counter, but can be used
          to decrement a counter instead.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Any of these three expressions or the the code in the code block can be
      omitted. <br />
      for loops are commonly used to run code a set number of times. Also, you
      can use break to exit the loop early before the condition expression
      evaluates to false.

      // for Loop


      // Syntax
      // for (initialization; condition; finalExpression) {
      // code
      // }

      // example 1(iterate through integers from 0-8)
      for(let i=0; i<9; i++) {
        console.log(i);
      }

      //ex 2 (use break to exit out of a for loop before condition is false)
      for (let i=1; i<10; i+=2){
        if 
        console.log("Total cat: " + i)
      }
