      A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular
      task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls
      it). <br />
      Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A
      function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that
      performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a
      function, it should take some input and return an output where there is
      some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a
      function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to
      call it. <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Function Declarations <br />
      A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
      statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
      <ul>
        <li>The name of the function.</li>
        <li>
          A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
          separated by commas.
        </li>
        <li>
          The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
          brackets, { /* … */ }.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      Why Functions? <br />
      You can reuse code. Define the code once and use it many times. You can
      use the same code many times with different arguments to produce different
      results.
